#### Note: Spotify unexpectedly announced [important changes](https://developer.spotify.com/blog/2024-11-27-changes-to-the-web-api) to their web API after the project was completed. This included the deprecation of the [get_recommendation](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-recommendations) function which our program heavily relies on.
